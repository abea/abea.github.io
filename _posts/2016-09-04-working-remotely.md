Over the summer my team at Singlebrook was merged into the Drupal development team at Minneapolis' [OriginEight](https://www.origineight.net/). This has meant a few things, including going back to being full-on remote working.

From my previous experience remote from Oceana to now, I've thought a lot about what makes this model work. I don't think I've ever been able to clearly conceive and express the machinations of productive remote work as well as this post by Jonathan Snook.

I encourage you to check it out. The do and don't that most resonate with me are the importance of discrete tasks and the difficulties of managing a team remotely. I'm fortunate to be able to work with a good, global team from my home. Keeping an eye on how its done well will continue to be important for me (as well as the growing number of student partner/developers I meet in this college town).
