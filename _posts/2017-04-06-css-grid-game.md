I'm a huge fan of [the flexbox spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) in CSS. Simply making vertical centering simple is worth the price of admission. That said, CSS Grid may be a bigger deal. In short, it makes CSS layouts a real practice in a way that has never really been the case before. In slightly less short, [watch this 3+ minute video of Jen Simmons on why she loves CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY-MHUsG6ls). In full, [watch this talk by Rachel Andrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Lt1SLqBmQ), the foremost CSS Grid evangelist.

Assuming you're on board with Grid (Should I still be using uppercase? Not sure.), it's time to learn how to use it. I first played with it using the cheat sheet on CSS Tricks, but [the game by Thomas Park](http://cssgridgarden.com/) is opening all the doors for me. It's simple, incremental, and seems pretty comprehensive. The "levels" are so small that you can do a few at a time and keep the tab open for later. I really encourage you to make use of this as I have.
