I recently had the opportunity to present to our local web development Meetup group again. This time I gave an introduction to my favorite front end partner, Sass.

If you write CSS styles professionally, you really should be using a pre-processor in your work. Sass, along with Less and the others, power up our work to make it faster, more reliable, and simpler to make better products… as long as you use them well. Things can go wrong like with any tool, but it’s easy enough to learn and ease into using Sass with the .scss “Sass CSS” syntax. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sass) and [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass) both have courses to help.

Anyway, you can [check out my slideshow here](../../../assets/talk-sass/index.html) and embedded below. Credit again to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) for powering the presentation.
