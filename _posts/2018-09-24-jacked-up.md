My site looks jacked up right now. If you're reading this in the future, picture... text. That's all it is. Black system font on a white background. The only real styling to speak of is keeping the text from going so wide it becomes unreadable. Why's this?

A few months ago, I was looking at a job application someone submitted to my employer (I'm a team lead, and so do that) and realized that our repository of these applications included historical applications, including mine. I went and looked at it, including the team leads' comments. Most were benign application review stuff and quite positive (I got the job). I then kept digging in Slack where my website and the phrase "kinda whack" came up. üòê (The same person also said "make him an offer," so we cool.)

They weren't wrong. It was weak and, very simply, I am tired of the old look. It didn't reflect my sensibilities anymore, the colors felt drab, and it looked like the design of a half-decent high school web designer.

A few mistakes I made:
- Overthinking color based on color tools and articles.
- Making the home page about content that _should_ be updated more often.
- Making the "home" nav link disappear on the home page (rather than have it consistently be the logo).
- Building a fun Github API design feature (which I want to use again somehow) in the drabbest colors.
- Making more site sections than I probably need.
- Making the site too flat.
- Seriously, those colors are not fun.

A few parting screenshots:

I honestly don't know that I'll come up with something eventually that won't be kinda whack. Design isn't an especially strong suit of mine. My plan is to play around, use some modern techniques, and keep it simple but playful.

Looking at a bunch of developer and designers' personal sites, I've come up with a good list of inspiration sites to guide me. A few select ones include:

## The state of the website
To help start fully fresh, I'm going back to the true basics. Other than setting system fonts, the max-width, temporarily controlling image size, and sticky footer, we're full-on semantic HTML elements as the W3C intended. Not a `div` in sight. I'll try to keep writing along the way to document some of my thinking and the mistakes I continue to make.

For now, I'll leave with a couple of shots of the current state of things for posterity:
