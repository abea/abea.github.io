title: Accordion 01
short-description: Accordion component with smooth and engaging transitions
---

This accordion was built for a recent Wordpress project. In the Wordpress template, the accordion items were generated with a custom post type query.

Like many simpler JS-driven transition component effects, I went with a class toggle approach to control the component states. Then, using careful box model math, I sought to create a smooth transition between states that leaves constant elements (e.g., the header and teaser) in essentially the same location while shifting the component size and margin.

Check out the mobile/tablet breakpoints for the more interesting variation.
