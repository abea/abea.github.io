> These are my tools. There are many like them but these ones are mine.

Every developer has their preferred tools for their work. Some change fairly frequently, but these are my core tools and ones that have become steady partners in code.

## Dev tools
- **Atom**: I know VS Code is snappier and definitely handles huge files better. Still, I'm keyed in to Atom, it works well, and it feels better to have something run by Github as a cornerstone of my work than by Microsoft.
- **iTerm**: My lead dev introduced me to iTerm and many of the customizations I still use on my first day of my first full-time dev job. Syntax highlighting and easy split window management are the biggest gains.
- **[Meslo LG font](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font)**: I've used this almost since I started using iTerm. It's one of many OSS fonts I downloaded around then and I simply like this one the best for daily work.
- **[svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo)**: A fantastic tool to optimize SVGs from the command line. It's more flexible than that, but I mostly use it from the CLI.
  - **[Localhost Swap bookmarklet](/projects/#localhost-swap)**: My bookmarklet for quickly switching from website URLs to the locally-running version.
<!-- - Dot files (this needs updating) -->

### Web tools
- **[Autoprefixer CSS online](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)**: There is no web tool I use more. I support many old projects that don't have a build process, so this helps me quickly autoprefix new-ish CSS rules.
- **[Sassmeister](http://www.sassmeister.com/)**: My favorite preprocessor has a great side benefit of inspiring great tool names. This one is great for quickly testing Sass or creating demo code.
- **[FillMurray](http://www.fillmurray.com/)**: You can use your cats, dogs, bears, or grey squares for placeholder images. I'll use Bill Murray's sweet face.

## Desktop apps
- **Firefox**: It's run by a nonprofit, fast, and feature rich; it's my browser. From all I can tell it has the best privacy options of the major browsers. Chrome has some better dev tools for advanced tasks, so I only switch to it when I need those.
- **1Password**: Use a password manager. Please. Do it. This is the best one I've seen.
- **[Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/)**: This is probably the longest serving tool here. From application and file launching to doing quick math (and copying the result) to displaying huge text on my screen for giggles, it does so much for me (though recent OSX 10.14 issues have me on Alfred at work).
- **iA Writer**: My choice for longer writing these days. It's attractive, minimal, affordable, and has great markdown support.
- **aText**: TextExpander might do more, but aText is great for text replacement and is super affordable.
- **BetterTouchTool**: I have a lot of windows open while working. Quicksilver lets me switch them easily, but BetterTouchTool lets me arrange them quickly and easily. As with other tools of mine, it does more than just that, but that's what I mainly use it for.
