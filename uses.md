Though I get a little better at resisting playing with all the latest shiny tools every day, I do enjoy a lot that others have created. Here are a bunch that I like and have used while working on this and other sites.

### Editor and Terminal
- Atom
- iTerm2
- [font]
- Dot files

### Key tools and apps
- SVGO
- aText
- iaWriter
- Firefox
- Quicksilver

### Web tools
- [Sassmeister](http://www.sassmeister.com/): My favorite preprocessor has a great side benefit of inspiring great tool names. This one is great for quickly testing Sass or creating demo code.
- [FillMurray](http://www.fillmurray.com/): You can use your cats, dogs, bears, or grey squares for placeholder images. I'll use Bill Murray's sweet face.
