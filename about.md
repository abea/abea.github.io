Howdy. I am a front end developer and proponent of building efficient, accessible, and highly usable web experiences.

I've always appreciated the power of the web, but [took a roundabout way to becoming a developer]({{ site.config.linkedin }}). I've been a academic nerd in grad school, studying digital communications. After that I was a digital advocacy nerd, supporting a couple of great climate change and environmental organizations. Finally, I started focusing in on being a web development nerd, as a technical project manager then developer.

I'm constantly impressed, excited, and a occasionally overwhelmed by all the languages, services, and techniques that we have available. [Please check out some of my latest work](/work/) for some of what I've done with them lately.

My primary interests are:

- open-source CMS, including Drupal and Wordpress
- semantic, accessible HTML
- component-based styling with Sass/CSS
- progressive enhancement with Javascript and jQuery
- efficient workflows using Grunt

## Speaking

I've enjoyed giving talks at my local web development Meetups.

## Favorite tools

Though I get a little better at resisting playing with all the latest shiny tools every day, I do enjoy a lot that others have created. Here are a bunch that I like and have used while working on this and other sites.

- [Coolors](http://coolors.co/app/): Color palette inspiration for non-designers like me.
- [Sassmeister](http://www.sassmeister.com/): My favorite preprocessor has a great side benefit of inspiring great tool names. This one is great for quickly testing Sass or creating demo code.
- [FillMurray](http://www.fillmurray.com/): You can use your cats, dogs, bears, or grey squares for placeholder images. I'll use Bill Murray's sweet face.
- [Unsplash.it](https://unsplash.it/): When placeholder images need to be a bit more serious for client work, the photos from Unsplash are beautiful and versatile.
