Howdy. I am a front end web developer based in Ithaca, NY, currently building the web with [Singlebrook Technology](http://singlebrook.com). We are proudly a B Corp and love working with clients who share a passion for making a better world. I specialize in and love learning about responsive, accessible, and highly usable web development.

I've always appreciated the power of the web, but [took a roundabout way to becoming a developer]({{ site.theme.linkedin }}). I earned a B.A. in communication from Marist and and M.A. in the same from Virginia Tech. I then ran social media and email for a couple of great climate change organizations, was a project manager and digital strategist, then ran a digital communications team for an international nonprofit. Moving far from the big cities was the push I needed to go into coding full time.

Now as a developer, I'm constantly impressed, excited, and a occasionally overwhelmed by all the languages, services, and techniques that we have available. [Please check out my latest work](/work/) for what I've done with them lately.

My primary interests are:

- open-source CMS, including Drupal and Wordpress
- semantic, accessible HTML
- component-based styling with Sass/CSS
- progressive enhancement with Javascript and jQuery
- efficient workflows using Grunt

If you're interested in working together or simply discussing generally important or cool matters, send me a message at [alex@abcreations.co](mailto:alex@abcreations.co). I'll reply as soon as I'm able.
