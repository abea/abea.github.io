- Based on first part discussing what it means to be front end.
- Thoughts
  - HTML/CSS is enough, but limiting.
  - In any discipline, there are levels.
    - Only HTML/CSS doesn't necessarily mean you're a beginner. You could have real expertise in semantic HTML and bleeding edge CSS.
    - Knowing additional skills (e.g., JS, JS frameworks, a11y), makes you more skilled, more valuable.
    - Similarly, knowing only JS and even JS frameworks limits skill and value.
